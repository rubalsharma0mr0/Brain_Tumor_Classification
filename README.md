In this project, I made an efficient net model and train it on a Brain MRI dataset. This dataset has more than 3000 Brain MRI scans which are categorized in four classes - 
1.	Glioma Tumour, 
2.	Meningioma Tumour, 
3.	Pituitary Tumour and 
4.	No Tumour.

The objective of this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Brain MRI scans that belong to one of the four classes with reasonably high accuracy. 

Skills used in this project: 

1.	Programming in Python, 
2.	a theoretical understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks and 
3.	optimization techniques.

Learning Objectives

1.	Get familiar with the Google Colab Environment
2.	Clone Github Repository to our workspace.
3.	Learn to create and access directories in Python.
4.	Perform Data Visualization
5.	Perform Data Preprocessing
6.	Learn how to save data in directories using Python
7.	Learn to perform Data Augmentation.
8.	Create Train, Validation and Test Sets using Image Data Generator in Keras.
9.	Train an Efficient Net Model in Keras to perform Image Classification.
10.	Learn to use the trained model to make predictions on new set of data.

Special thanks to Mr. Ashish Arya (Project Mentor) from Coursera for mentoring me complete this project.
