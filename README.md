# Brain_Tumor_Classification

In this project, I made an efficient net model and train it on a Brain MRI dataset. This dataset has more than 3000 Brain MRI scans which are categorized in four classes - 
1.	Glioma Tumour, 
2.	Meningioma Tumour, 
3.	Pituitary Tumour and 
4.	No Tumour. 
The objective of this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Brain MRI scans that belong to one of the four classes with reasonably high accuracy. 
Skills used in this project: 
1.	Programming in Python, 
2.	a theoretical understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks and 
3.	optimization techniques.
