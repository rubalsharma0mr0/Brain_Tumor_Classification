In this project, I made an efficient net model and train it on a Brain MRI dataset. This dataset has more than 3000 Brain MRI scans which are categorized in four classes - 
1.	Glioma Tumour, 
2.	Meningioma Tumour, 
3.	Pituitary Tumour and 
4.	No Tumour.

The objective of this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Brain MRI scans that belong to one of the four classes with reasonably high accuracy. 

Skills used in this project: 

1.	Programming in Python, 
2.	a theoretical understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks and 
3.	optimization techniques.

Learning Objectives

1.	Get familiar with the Google Colab Environment
2.	Clone Github Repository to our workspace.
3.	Learn to create and access directories in Python.
4.	Perform Data Visualization
5.	Perform Data Preprocessing
6.	Learn how to save data in directories using Python
7.	Learn to perform Data Augmentation.
8.	Create Train, Validation and Test Sets using Image Data Generator in Keras.
9.	Train an Efficient Net Model in Keras to perform Image Classification.
10.	Learn to use the trained model to make predictions on new set of data.

    <h1>Brain Tumor Classification</h1>
    <p>This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with a project that aims to classify brain tumor images using a deep learning model.</p>

    <p>The project uses the following dataset: <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427">https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427</a></p>

    <p>The notebook covers the following topics:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
        <li>Data Augmentation</li>
        <li>Model Building and Training</li>
        <li>Model Evaluation</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p>In order to run the Jupyter Notebook in this repository, you will need the following packages installed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>TensorFlow 2.x</li>
        <li>Keras</li>
        <li>NumPy</li>
        <li>Pandas</li>
        <li>Matplotlib</li>
        <li>Scikit-learn</li>
        <li>Seaborn</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>To run the Jupyter Notebook, you can simply open it in your Jupyter environment of choice and run the cells. You will need to download the dataset from the link provided above and place it in a directory named <code>brain_tumor_dataset</code> in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.</p>

    <p>The notebook has been designed to be self-explanatory and includes detailed comments throughout the code.</p>

    <h2>Credits</h2>

    <p>This project was created by Rubal Sharma. The dataset used in this project was created by Ali Arslan and can be found at the following link: <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427">https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427</a>.</p>
